1,Hard limit,Hard limit has been triggered. Machine position is likely lost due to sudden stop. Re-homing is highly recommended.
2,Soft limit,G-code motion target exceeds machine travel. Machine position safely retained. Alarm may be unlocked.
3,Abort during cycle,Reset while in motion. Grbl cannot guarantee position. Lost steps are likely. Re-homing is highly recommended.
4,Probe fail,If probe is not in the expected initial state before starting probe cycle when G38.2 and G38.3 is not triggered and G38.4 and G38.5 is triggered.
5,Probe fail,If the probe fails to contact the workpiece within the programmed travel for G38.2 and G38.4.
6,Homing fail,If the active homing cycle was reset.
7,Homing fail,If the safety door was opened during homing cycle.
8,Homing fail,Pull off travel failed to clear limit switch. Try increasing pull-off setting or check wiring.
9,Homing fail,Failed to find limit switch within travel. Defined as `1.5 * max_travel` on search and `5 * pulloff` on locate phases.
